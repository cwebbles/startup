# Notes

## GitHub
- GitHub is a very useful tool. The cli and the ui are very helpful, I will try to learn them and not want to use WebStorm ;)

## AWS
- EC2 instances are small bite-sized allocations of computer space where you can run web applications.
- To access my EC2: ssh -i [path to key] ubuntu@[public dns]
- Elastic IP: 3.221.30.186
