## Elevator Pitch

Do you get lost out there in the Starfield? Sidetracked by numerous quests and sidequests? Do you want a single place to keep track of all the things you want to do, and all the things you have done? Do you want to be able to share your adventures with your friends? Then you need the Starfield StarLog! With the Starfield StarLog you can keep track of the things you've done, the things you want to do, and share your adventures with your friends!
